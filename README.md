# BeatApp
Web application with "paper.js" and "howl" to have some fun pressing keys on your keyboard.
I realize it as a part of a "web developer boot camp", practicing the use of external library in JavaScript.

Future Goals

- add random shapes and animations
- add the possibility to record and store your own beat sequences
