# BeatApp

Web application with "paper.js" and "howler.js". It let you play a sound and run a little animation everytime you press a key o your keyboard (it works for letters key)

I realize it as a part of a "web developer bootcamp" (with Colt Steel), practicing the use of external libraries in JavaScript.

Future Goals:

- add random shapes and animations
- add the possibility to record and store your own beat sequences
